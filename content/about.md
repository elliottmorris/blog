## This website

This website is inspired by [Bear blog](https://bearblog.dev). We believe that there is a "website obesity crisis." Bloated websites are full of scripts, ads, and trackers slowing us down, diverting our attention, and distracting our focus.

This website is the opposite. It is small --- each pageload is just ~5kb, about 50,000 times smaller than a vertical video --- and focused on exactly one thing: information flow. The website contains no scripts, trackers, cookies or snooping analytics.

This website is generated on a server only once each time we update content, using Hugo, a lightweight static website generator. Learn more about Bear at [GitHub](https://github.com/HermanMartinus/bearblog).
