* On public opinion:
    * Divide between the goal and implementation. Shoring up American industry is popular, but 25% tariffs on Mexican and Canadian imports isn't (espeically energy) 
    * Trump has pitched his economic actions as necessary for America's national interests, even if that means costs go up. This is not a calculus most people are likely to agree with; Getting prices down was a core promise of Trump's 2024 campaign!

Steel stocks have risen since Trump announced more narrow tariffs on imports of steel and aluminium. Why? Power of the steel lobby? Maybe he hates Canada?
