This page is my second post. I am writing it in Alacrity on linux, while I upload files to a private fileserver.

I am writing the post on nano, but will probably switch to something else. Maybe I cna find what I need on [google](google.com). 

The syntax highlighting on this browser is very nice... I am happy.

Saving now and sending to the web. Let's see if netlifty publishes it properly.
