- Talked with DR about "conditional polling" idea, and about zip-code level MRP. Can replicate for purposes useful for voter file augmentation and live projection during election-night.

- Yuval Levin on Ezra Klein podcast today. Representatives are not responding to public opinion in their districts, but the opinions of a small minority of older voters who watch cable news, and to the opinions of a select few social media influencers that command attention of their younger voters and the representative's social groups.

    - This is usually pitched as a positive development by the right --- mainstrea media losing power! yay! --- but I view it as dangerous and counter-majoritarian. Media instututions concentrated power in a few individuals who were downstream of a journalistic process carried out by staff, producers, researchers, and fact-checkers. What are the guardrails on the fragmented partisan outlets, and on the influencers? 

- Met about economics tracking. We want an interactive that measures macro trends in the economy as well as presents information about personal finances so that people know how to connect to the numbers.
